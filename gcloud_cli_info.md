# Google Cloud CLI Information

## gcloud CLI Overview (from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)

The Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI) is a set of tools for creating and managing Google Cloud resources. It can be used for command-line tasks, scripts, and automation.

**Key Uses:**
*   Manage Compute Engine VMs, Cloud SQL instances, Google Kubernetes Engine clusters, Dataproc clusters/jobs, Cloud DNS, and Deployment Manager deployments.
*   Deploy App Engine applications, manage authentication, and customize local configuration.

**Installation & Version:**
*   Current version (as of docs): 525.0.0. It's recommended to use the current version.
*   Cloud Shell has gcloud CLI pre-installed. Otherwise, download, install, and initialize.
*   Installs General Availability (GA) commands by default. Alpha and Beta components (`alpha`, `beta`) can be installed separately for early access features.

**Cheat Sheet:**
*   A [cheat sheet](/sdk/docs/cheatsheet) is available for common commands and structure.

**Release Levels:**
*   **General Availability (GA):** No label. Stable, production-ready.
*   **Beta (`beta`):** Functionally complete, but potential issues and breaking changes without notice.
*   **Alpha (`alpha`):** Early release, may change without notice.
*   Alpha/Beta components need separate installation (`gcloud components install`).

**Command Groups:**
*   Organized in a nested hierarchy representing products/features (e.g., `gcloud compute instances`, `gcloud beta compute`).

**Running Commands:**
*   From command line or scripts. Long commands can use `\` (Unix) or `^` (Windows) for line continuation.

**Properties & Configurations:**
*   **Properties:** Settings affecting gcloud CLI behavior (e.g., `accessibility/screen_reader`).
*   **Configurations:** Named sets of properties (like profiles). `default` configuration is created initially. Multiple configurations can be created (`gcloud config configurations create`) for different projects/accounts. Set properties within a configuration (e.g., `gcloud config set project <project-id>`).

**Global Options & Arguments:**
*   **Global Options:** Govern command behavior per-invocation, override properties (e.g., `--quiet`, `--verbosity`).
*   **Positional Arguments:** Define entities for commands.
*   **Options:** Set variations in command behavior.

**Output Handling:**
*   Successful command output to `stdout`. Prompts, warnings, errors to `stderr`.
*   `--quiet` (`-q`): Disables interactive prompts, uses defaults.
*   `--no-user-output-enabled`: Suppresses output to terminal.
*   `--verbosity`: Sets log verbosity (debug, info, warning, error, critical, none).
*   `--format`: Fine-tunes output format (tabulated, flattened, json, csv, yaml, value).
*   `projections` & `filter`: Further refine output.

## Initializing the gcloud CLI (from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/cloudplatform, which redirects to /sdk/docs/initializing)

`gcloud init` is used for initial setup, changing settings, or creating new configurations.

**`gcloud init` steps:**
1.  Authorizes gcloud CLI with user credentials (or selects an existing authorized account).
2.  Sets up a configuration and base properties (active account, current project, default Compute Engine region/zone if applicable).

**Alternatives to `gcloud init`:**
*   `gcloud auth login`: Authorize user account without full configuration setup.
*   `gcloud auth activate-service-account`: Authorize with a service account (non-interactive).
*   `gcloud config [...]`, `gcloud config configurations [...]`: Manage configurations and properties directly.

**Initialization Process:**
1.  Run `gcloud init`. Use `--no-launch-browser` for remote sessions if browser access is unavailable from the terminal.
2.  Create or select a configuration. (New installs get a `default` configuration).
3.  Complete authorization (browser login or select existing account). If `--no-launch-browser` was used, copy-paste URL to a browser. Sets `account` property.
4.  Choose a current Google Cloud project (if access to multiple). Sets `project` property.
5.  Choose a default Compute Engine zone (if applicable). Sets `region` and `zone` properties.

View properties with `gcloud config list`.

## Client Libraries Explained (from https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained)

Client libraries simplify accessing Google Cloud APIs programmatically.

**Types of Client Libraries:**

1.  **Cloud Client Libraries:**
    *   **Recommended option.**
    *   Provide idiomatic code for each language.
    *   Consistent style across services.
    *   Handle low-level communication, including authentication.
    *   Installable via package managers (npm, pip).
    *   May offer performance benefits using gRPC.

2.  **Google API Client Libraries:**
    *   Previous style, used if Cloud Client Libraries aren't available for a language/API or for upgrading existing projects.
    *   Access REST interface only (no gRPC).
    *   Autogenerated interface code, may be less idiomatic.
    *   Handle authentication.
    *   Installable via package managers.

**Other Ways to Access APIs:**

*   **Firebase Mobile Platform:** SDK for accessing mobile-relevant Cloud APIs from iOS, Android, Web.
*   **Your Own Client Code:**
    *   **REST/HTTP APIs:** All Cloud APIs expose a JSON/REST interface.
    *   **gRPC APIs:** Language-neutral, platform-neutral RPC system. gRPC-enabled APIs have both REST and RPC interfaces. Clients can use protocol buffers and gRPC over HTTP2. Service definitions (protobuf) are often on GitHub.
        *   Cloud Client Libraries for gRPC-enabled APIs increasingly use gRPC "under the hood" for better performance.
*   **Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`):** For command-line access.
*   **Google Cloud Console:** Web-based UI.
