# How to Download a GPT4All Model for Windows

1. Go to https://gpt4all.io/index.html
2. Download a compatible model file, e.g. `ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin` (recommended for music/creative tasks).
3. Place the downloaded `.bin` file in your project root directory (e.g. `c:\Users\Michael\acoustical\`).
4. The code will automatically use this file by default. If you use a different filename or location, update the `model_path` argument in your code or CLI/web interface.

# Example CLI usage (if supported):
# python cli/cli.py flourish --engine gpt4all --model-path ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin --chords '[{"chord": "C"}, {"chord": "G"}]'

# Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about the model not being found, double-check the filename and path.
- If you see errors about missing LLM, make sure you have run: `acp.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install gpt4all`

# Note
- GPT4All models are large (3-8GB). Make sure you have enough disk space.
- No registration or API key is required for local inference.
